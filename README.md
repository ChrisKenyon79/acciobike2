# Accio Bike

#### A registry for your bicycle to proactively prevent and recover from bike thefts.

## About

Without creating an account, a user can search the database of missing bikes for
information like a bicycle's unique serial number, brand, model, color, size, 
or the zip code from which it went missing. If your bike has gone missing, create 
a free account and fill in your bike's information. Searching Craigslist for a used
bike to purchase? Check our missing registry to ensure you're not buying someone 
else's stolen property.

## Approach Taken

We decided early-on to build an app that had a unique niche of dedicated users. Most importantly, we focused 
on creating a service that we would use and was relevant. Seattle is a bike-centric city, which unfortunately also
makes it a target for bicycles thieves. After reading about Bike Batman, the Seattle vigilante who scours Craigslist 
ads for stolen bikes being flipped for a quick buck, we settled on a registry that could help the recover and prevent 
bike-related crimes.

Whiteboarding wireframes/ERD diagrams and clearly outlining our CRUD functionality kept the project organized and 
merge conflicts minimal, as everyone had a clearly delegated job. We separated components into self-contained partials 
which allowed group members to tackle features displayed on the same page. 

Keeping organized with a clear vision of our minimum viable product allowed us to quickly and efficiently dial in our 
required features and move on to the fun stuff. We had time to try our hands at Cloudinary image uploads, interactive 
jQuery forms Nokogiri data scraping, SVG/CSS animations, and a hand-coded search function.
