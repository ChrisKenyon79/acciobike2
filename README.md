# Accio Bike

A registry for your bicycle to proactively prevent and recover from bike thefts.
Without creating an account, a user can search the database of missing bikes for
information like a bicycle's unique serial number, brand, model, color, size, 
or the zip code from which it went missing. If your bike has gone missing, create 
a free account and fill in your bike's information. Searching Craigslist for a used
bike to purchase? Check our missing registry to ensure you're not buying someone 
else's stolen property.
